```

#### Test Data Management
```bash
codex "Set up test data management for my API with:
- Database test fixtures
- Factory patterns for test data generation
- Test database setup and teardown

```

### 6. Documentation and API Design

#### API Documentation
```bash
codex "Generate comprehensive API documentation including:
