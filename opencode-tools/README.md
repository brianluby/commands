# 🔧 OpenCode Native Tools
*Conversational Development Assistants*

## What Makes These Different

These are **not** Claude Code slash commands. They're designed specifically for **OpenCode's conversational interface** and provide unique value through:

- 📝 **Natural Language Interface**: No commands to memorize - just describe what you need
- 🤖 **Context-Aware Integration**: Intelligently works with your existing codebase
- 🔄 **Progressive Development**: Build features incrementally through conversation
- 🎯 **Smart Adaptation**: Adjusts recommendations based on your project's patterns

## Core Philosophy

**Traditional Tools**: Template → Implementation → Done
**OpenCode Tools**: Conversation → Understanding → Collaborative Building → Iterative Refinement

## Available Tools

### 🔧 API Generator
**Instead of**: Rigid API scaffolding
**Provides**: Conversational API development that integrates with your existing codebase
```
"I need user management for my FastAPI app"
→ Analyzes existing code, suggests integration points, builds incrementally
```

### 🛡️ Security Auditor  
**Instead of**: Static security scanning
**Provides**: Interactive security analysis with contextual remediation
```
"Check my API security before deployment"
→ Scans with framework awareness, explains findings, guides fixes
```

### 🐳 Container Optimizer *(Coming Soon)*
**Instead of**: Docker template generation
**Provides**: Intelligent containerization of existing applications

### ☸️ K8s Deployment Assistant *(Coming Soon)*
**Instead of**: Static manifest generation
**Provides**: Conversational Kubernetes deployment planning

### 🧪 Test Framework Builder *(Coming Soon)*
**Instead of**: Test boilerplate generation
**Provides**: Intelligent test strategy and incremental test building

## How to Use

### Start a Conversation
Just describe what you need:
- "Help me secure my API"
- "I need better error handling in my Express app"
- "Add authentication to my Django project"
- "Optimize my Docker containers"

### Progressive Enhancement
Build features through dialogue:
1. **Describe** your need
2. **Discuss** implementation options
3. **Refine** based on feedback
4. **Extend** with additional features

### Integration-First Approach
These tools **enhance** your existing code rather than replacing it:
- Detect your current tech stack
- Preserve existing patterns
- Suggest complementary improvements
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Approach | Claude Code Commands | Generic AI | OpenCode Tools |
|----------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Interface** | Slash commands | Prompting | Natural conversation |
| **Integration** | Template-based | Manual adaptation | Automatic detection |
| **Workflow** | Command → Result | Question → Answer | Conversation → Building |
| **Adaptation** | Fixed templates | Generic responses | Context-aware solutions |
| **Learning** | Command syntax | Prompt engineering | Natural description |

## Getting Started

1. **Describe** your development need in natural language
2. **Engage** in conversation about implementation options  
3. **Collaborate** on building the solution incrementally
4. **Iterate** and refine based on your feedback

No commands to learn, no templates to understand - just describe what you need and start building together.
